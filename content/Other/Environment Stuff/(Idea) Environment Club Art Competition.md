## What it will be
- People from the town will submit art that somehow raises awareness of the environment or climate change
- This art will later be displayed somewhere
- There will be no entry fee
- Could we somehow get prizes?
- The big thing: after judging all projects will be placed somewhere like the cafeteria so people can see them
- Trying to get a judge from RWU or RISD
