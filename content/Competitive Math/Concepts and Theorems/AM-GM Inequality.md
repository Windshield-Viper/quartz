Any list of non-negative real numbersâ€™ arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to its geometric mean. Equality occurs if all elements of said list are the same.

> So for any $x_1,  x_2, \ldots, x_n \geq 0$, $\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}$ 
> Equality occurs$\iff$ $x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n$.

This is usable in a surprising variety of problems. Many extensions of this theorem also exist.
