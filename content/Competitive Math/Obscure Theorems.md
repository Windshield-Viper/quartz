# Chicken McNugget Theorem
AKA Postage Stamp Problem or Frobenius Coin Problem. States that for any two relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$, the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $am + bn$ for nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ is $mn-m-n$.
- A consequence of the theorem is that there are exactly $\frac{(m - 1)(n - 1)}{2}$ positive integers which cannot be expressed in the form $am + bn$. The proof is based on the fact that in each pair of the form $(k, mn-m-n-k)$, exactly one element is expressible.
