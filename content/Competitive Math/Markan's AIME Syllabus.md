### *Strategies*
- Always look for similar triangles.
- Look for congruent angles, especially from cyclic quadrilaterals and similar triangles.
- Questions asking for length ratios may require you to draw parallel lines.
- Trapezoid problems with two diagonals drawn usually involve similar triangles.
- What constraint haven’t you used?
- Pythagorean theorem is everywhere. Extend lines and drop altitudes as needed.
- Under-constrained diagrams: there may be an inequality constraint. 
- Tangency problems: draw radii, use Pythagorean theorem. 
- Look for isoceles triangles, due to perpendicular bisectors or equal angles.
- Isoceles triangles: drawing an altitude sometimes helps.
