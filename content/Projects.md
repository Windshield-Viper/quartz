## Coding
Check out my [Github](https://github.com/Windshield-Viper) for a comprehensive list. Here are a few highlights:
### Tree-Plenish
I’m a software developer for [Tree-Plenish](https://www.tree-plenish.org/). I work on projects related to their data pipeline.
### Machine learning
I’m working on projects relating to deep learning as well, with a variety of real-world applications.
- One such project is my [Actinopterygii Location Prediction Model](https://github.com/Windshield-Viper/Actinopterygii-Location-Model), which predicts locations of fish in the class *Actinopterygii* given various information about them from an IUCN dataset. For this project, I used Pandas and FastAI.
### Computer club website
I’m one of the developers. Our site is coded using Typescript and the Astro framework, and although I’m not super familiar with those languages, contributing to the site has been a lesson in how to cobble and hack things together as well as how to collaborate with others on a shared project.

## Chess
I’m a part of the 5-person chess team at my school. Duties involve competing in chess competitions across the state as well as leading and promoting our larger school chess club.

## Mathematics
I enjoy competing in math competitions like the AIME and HMMT and also doing math in school. Most of all, I like doing math with my friends.
- My website [sidsmathnotes.vercel.app](https://sidsmathnotes.vercel.app) is a wiki of all my notes for AP Calculus AB. My friends and I use it as a study resource, and making the notes is a great way for me to [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).
