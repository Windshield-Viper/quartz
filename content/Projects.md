## Coding
Check out my [Github](https://github.com/Windshield-Viper) for a comprehensive list. Here are a few highlights:
### Tree-Plenish
I’m a software developer for [Tree-Plenish](https://www.tree-plenish.org/). I work on projects related to their data pipeline.
### Machine learning
I’m working on projects relating to deep learning as well, with a variety of real-world applications.
- One such project is my [Actinopterygii Location Prediction Model](https://github.com/Windshield-Viper/Actinopterygii-Location-Model), which predicts locations of fish in the class *Actinopterygii* given various information about them from an IUCN dataset. For this project, I used Pandas and FastAI.
## Chess

## Mathematics
Doing math – competing in things like the AMCs and AIME. Yes, I’m a nerd.
