## Chess
Making the chess club at my school a more accessible place. We’re working on ways to reach out to the greater school community. Often, chess ends up seeming like an inaccessible pursuit, and me and the other chess team members hope to change that.
## Mathematics
Doing math – competing in things like the AMCs and AIME. Yes, I’m a nerd.
