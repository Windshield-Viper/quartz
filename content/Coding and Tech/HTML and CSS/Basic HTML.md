## Starting Out
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Hello!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello, world!
    </body>
<html>
```
- First, the `doctype` is declared
- Then the language of the page
- Then, the `head` section
	- This section has important things like the title.
- Then, the `body` section.
	- This is the rest of the visible portion of the page.

The DOM (Document Object Model) is shown here:

## More HTML Elements
- `<!-- -->` is a comment.
- Headings go from `<h1> </h1>` all the way to `h6`.
