## Classes
In Java, a **class** specifies data (**attributes**) that each object will contain. It also specifies methods that the class can call.
- For example: a `PhoneBook` class that has the attributes `names` and `phoneNumbers` and the methods `addName`, `removeName`, `lookUpName`, and `getPhoneNumber`. 
- When you design a class,  you need to define its attributes.  
- When we create an object of a class we need to define a variable which is an instance of the class.
## Objects
- Classes are not used directly in Java.
- Instead, **objects** are created using classes as a template. Every object is an instance of a class.
	- So, objects also have characteristics/attributes (called data) and actions/behaviors called methods that are used to manipulate the data.
- **Encapsulation** is the Java feature that packages attributes and behaviors into a single unit.
