## General Thoughts
- not sure whether it’s better to work on the CPI course or just the usaco guide
	- maybe usaco guide?
- Try to be very productive today
	- clarinet absolutely needs to be done
- **New comp math plan**: realize that it’s really not that tough. And so, what important is learning how to do the tougher problems and getting experience with them.
