## About this site
This site was created with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a static site generator that turns Markdown into a web-based digital garden. The idea behind this site is to have a way to share my ideas in a way that’s flexible, scalable, and most of all, cool. While a better format to share my ideas might exist, [[No Free Lunch Theorem|finding one would take far too long]].

Are sites like these more work to create and maintain? Yes. But they’re also AWESOME. That’s why I chose this format.
