Stuff I like.
## Coding/Tech
I really enjoy coding and messing with computers! Most of my interests are in AI, data science, and machine learning. Find my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Windshield-Viper).
## Chess
Some of my favorite openings are the London System and the Sicilian Defense. I mostly play online but enjoy going to in-person tournaments as well; of course, I enjoy attending chess club meetings as well where I can play with my friends.
## Math
I enjoy competition math (things like the AMCs, AIME, etc.) I’m taking AP Calculus AB at school this year; I’ve created a linked notes document of LaTeX/Markdown notes for AP Calculus (published at [sidsmathnotes.vercel.app](https://sidsmathnotes.vercel.app))
## Video Games
Currently playing: Hollow Knight, Risk of Rain 2. I enjoy a pretty wide variety of games and mostly play single-player.
## Music
Electronic/hip-hop music is mainly what I listen to. I also play the clarinet!
