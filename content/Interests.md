## Coding/Tech
I really enjoy coding and messing with computers! Most of my interests are in AI, data science, and machine learning. As a high schooler, I still have so much to learn, but I’m enjoying diving into the fields. Find my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Windshield-Viper).
## Chess
Some of my favorite openings are the **London System**…

…and the **Sicilian Defense (Najdorf Variation)**.

I mostly play online but enjoy going to in-person tournaments as well. Most of all, I like attending our chess club meetings, where I can play bughouse with my friends.
## Math
Especially competition math (I know, I’m a nerd.) I try to find bridges between math and tech; so far I’ve created a linked notes document of LaTeX/Markdown notes for AP calculus (published at [sidsmathnotes.vercel.app](sidsmathnotes.vercel.app))
## Video Games
Currently playing: Hollow Knight, Risk of Rain 2. I enjoy unconventional games and mostly play single-player.
## Music
Electronic/hip-hop mainly. Daft Punk forever!
