## The State of Deep Learning
### Computer vision
- Good at object recognition and detection
- Not good at recognizing things that werenâ€™t in the training data
- Image labeling can be slow and expensive
### NLP
- Good at classification, sentiment analysis, and generating text
- Not good at generating *correct* responses
### Other techniques
- Combining text and images can yield good results.
- Tabular data can be used with regards to DL but other things such as random forests might be able to do it better.

## Deploying a model
This can be done via Gradio and Huggingface Spaces. [Example notebook here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1orJkD9A4wyGaj1TZAevaM6wsjR0n7C9-)
- [[Tanishq Abraham)](https://tmabraham.github.io/blog/gradio_hf_spaces_tutorial|Info on using Gradio (Tanishq Abraham)]]

**To Do**: 
- [ ] use `fastsetup` to use a jupyter notebook to deploy something. ðŸ”¼
