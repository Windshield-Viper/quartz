Find the kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best/).
- In general, `resnet-18` is good for a quick and dirty model while something like `resnet-34` is better for a final model, but the best model depends on the exact performance vs. training/prediction time desired.
- [The linked notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best/) has a more detailed analysis of all the models in `timm`.
