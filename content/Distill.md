# Plans (see [[Planning and Projects/Overall Plans|main document]])
- FastAI course and related should help give me the tools I need for this year’s science fair
	- Internships can come later
- Work needs to be done on comp math to make sure I still make AIME this year
- Science fair this year
	- Do I want a mentor? Do I want partners?
		- Helping out at MathCounts
			- Email Orrall if I want to
			- If I do, I should refresh/learn LaTeX.
			- This is a big time commitment and will take away from things like lifesmarts.
	- What will my project be (ik data-related already)

# Ideas
- make a hackathon
	- could be for people in BHS or it could cast a wider net
	- main issues
		- people don’t know how to code
			- but we could teach them
